> **A professional mobile application for managing employee shifts, attendance tracking, and workforce coordination. Built with Flutter and Node.js for reliability and performance.**

## 👨‍💻 **My Contribution**

I was responsible for implementing two critical backend features that form the foundation of the ShiftMaster platform:

**🔐 Authentication & Security System**

- **End-to-End Authentication**: Implemented complete authentication flow including registration, login, logout, and password change functionality
- **JWT Token Management**: Built JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control (Admin/Employee) and secure token handling
- **Password Security**:
  - Password hashing with bcrypt (10 salt rounds) for secure storage
  - Current password verification for password change operations
  - Unique email and ID validation to prevent duplicate accounts
- **Access Control**: Implemented status-based authentication that blocks pending and inactive users from accessing the system
- **Security Features**:
  - Auth middleware for JWT validation and user context injection
  - Status-based authorization (pending, active, inactive, on leave)
  - Admin role management with isAdmin flag for role-based permissions

**👥 Employee & Shift Management System**

- **Employee Management**: Designed and implemented comprehensive employee management system with full CRUD operations
- **Admin Approval Workflow**: Built user approval system where new registrations require admin approval before activation
  - Pending user retrieval endpoint for admin review
  - Approve/reject functionality with status updates
  - Initial admin account creation with validation
- **Employee Status Management**: Created status tracking system (pending, active, inactive, on leave) with dedicated endpoints for status queries
- **Shift Assignment System**: Built complete shift management with:
  - Shift assignment to employees with date and shift type (morning/afternoon/night)
  - Full CRUD operations for shift management
  - Individual and bulk shift retrieval endpoints
  - Attendance integration for clock in/out operations
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Designed MongoDB schemas for Employee and Shift models with proper validation and relationships
  - Implemented 13+ RESTful API endpoints following REST principles
  - Built comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes 
  - Created cascading delete functionality (deleting employee also removes associated shifts)
  - Structured backend code with separation of concerns (routes, models, utilities)

**Architecture**: Both features follow clean architecture principles with clear separation between routes (API endpoints), models (MongoDB schemas), and utilities (database connection, network configuration) layers.
